                    <p>
                        I am assisting PhD candidate George Korir in developing an inexpensive microfluidic device inspired by a mechanical music box to perform malaria tests in low-resource settings. Like a music box, a paper punchcard is fed into the device--but instead of the holes in the punchcard causing metal tines to produce sound, the card represents a particular recipe for a given test. Not only is the device operated by handcrank--allowing it to be used in areas without an electrical grid--the punchcard design is fully programmable. While malaria diagnosis is currrently the primary focus, different punchcards could be designed to test for other diseases or complete alternative assays.

                        Over the summer of 2017, I redesigned the device form factor to save material and be better suited to injection molding production...

                    <p>With a partner, I am designing a temperature and humidity sensor for Leatherback sea turtles for the Leatherback Trust in Costa Rica. 

                    Sea turtle nest temperature monitoring is critical in the time of climate change. As the gender of a sea turtle hatchling depends on the temperature of the sand in which it is laid, rising global temperatures may be skewing gender ratios female, potentially affecting the species’ long-term survival. Currently, sea turtle researchers measure temperature with thermocouples—devices that are cheap and accurate, but are often lost in the sand and are labor intensive to use. More powerful temperature measurement devices are available, but their cost is prohibitive for the biologists’ use. Our sensor provides 24/7 data logging with little human intervention, saving the research team’s time and providing them with more data about the turtles’ nesting environment... <a href="http://leatherback-monitoring.github.io">[Project Blog]</a> <a href="/turtlesensor">[More]</a></p>

                    <h3>Model Electric Vehicle Design</h3>
                    <p>With a partner, I designed an approximately 1:10 scale model electric vehicle intended to be raced around a circular track.
                    <br><br>
                    With the exception of wheels, shocks, bearings, motors, and shafts, every component on the car is 3D printed, including the two differentials. While the fragility of small 3D printed parts was a design challenge, it allowed us to rapidly iterate the design of the car to account for observations and discoveries made in testing.  
                    <br><br>
                    The car features an all-wheel drive, independent suspension, and a dual-motor power transmission with easily adjustable gearing. I was primarily responsible for the suspension; my partner, the power transmission.</p>

                    <h3>Mechanical Model of a Mantis Shrimp</h3>
                    <p>In a partner project, I created a mechanical model of the linkages responsible for the mantis shrimp's strike. The mantis shrimp is an aquatic crustacean that uses a pair of short "claws" to strike its prey. The claws move so fast they can break glass and cause air cavitation bubbles in the water—with accelerations up to 10,400g (Patek et al. 2004). 
                    <br><br>
                    My classmate and I started by prototyping the linkage with cardboard and LEGOs. Using journal articles that described the mechanics of the mantis shrimp's strike, I designed a CAD model of the linkage mechanism that my classmate then fabricated.</p>

                    <h3>3D Periodic Table</h3>
                    <p>I created a 3D periodic table of the elements where the height of each element represents its electronegativity, or the relative ability of a given element to attract an electron. I designed the model and CNC machined it out of medium-density fiberboard (MDF).

                    The patterns chemical properties exhibit across the periodic table are a core concept in chemistry, yet they’re often hard to remember. By depicting chemical theory in the physical form, the model can be used as a teaching tool to provide students with a tactile sense of the elements.

                    I realized the table could be especially valuable to visually impaired students, who often experience difficulty accessing STEM subjects. My mind immediately jumped to an expansion of the project, where I envision creating a repository of open-source teaching tools that makerspaces could fabricate for their communities or distribute to those in low-income schools or in the developing world.</p>

                    <p>I welded a larger-than-life sculpture of a gecko that’s made out of bent aluminum rod. I chose the project partly to learn how to weld better, a skill I was hoping to bring into use on my FIRST Robotics team.

                    However, I had only TIG welded on flat, thick steel before, so moving to thin, round aluminum was a step up in difficulty that resulted in a lot of broken welds. Making the gecko’s fingers was especially tricky, requiring tight and precise bends in the metal— yes, a few gecko fingers were broken in the making of this piece. In the end, it was rewarding to get the hang of both bending and welding the metal, and seeing my creative work take shape.</p>

                    <p>When our school purchased a Tormach Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) mill, another student and I took the lead on its assembly. The experience spurred me to better understand what was involved in the design of a CNC machine—so I modeled a 3-axis CNC router that could be used as a desktop fabrication tool. 

                    In addition to completing the mechanical design, I planned out the electronics and determined the theoretical specifications of the machine. </p>

                    <p>As part of a 5-person group project, I led the design of a chemostat. By precisely controlling how fast nutrient broth is added and removed from a culture of bacteria, a chemostat can cause a colony to grow at an effectively linear rate.

                    The chemostat uses a peristaltic pump to insert sterile broth into a living bacteria colony and a vacuum to continuously remove the bacteria, creating an effect that limits the growth of the bacteria to a constant rate. Chemostats allow us to research the metabolisms and mutations of certain bacteria, as well as how limiting specific nutrients affects bacterial growth.

                    The chemostat was used by other students in the Experimental Biology Class at Nueva High School.<a href="/chemostat">[Larger Image]</a></p>

                    <p>Students in my 10th grade African History class were asked to create a poster representing one of six famous African musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries. My team took the project a little farther, creating a world map in which each strand of yarn represents one of singer Angelique Kidjo’s global connections—her inspirations, cultural influences, concerts, and charity work. For this team project, I designed and led the fabrication of the map, which is CNC routed.</p>
