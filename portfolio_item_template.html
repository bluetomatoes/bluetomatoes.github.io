                <p class="overflow ellipsis">I created a 3D periodic table of the elements where the height of each element represents its electronegativity, or the relative ability of a given element to attract an electron. I designed the model and CNC machined it out of medium-density fiberboard (MDF).

                The patterns chemical properties exhibit across the periodic table are a core concept in chemistry, yet theyâ€™re often hard to remember. By depicting chemical theory in the physical form, the model can be used as a teaching tool to provide students with a tactile sense of the elements.

                After finishing the project, I realized the table could be especially valuable to visually impaired students, who often experience difficulty accessing STEM subjects. My mind immediately jumped to an expansion of the project, where I envision creating a repository of open-source teaching tools that makerspaces could fabricate for their communities or distribute to those in low-income schools or in the developing world.<a href="#ptable">[More]</a></p>
