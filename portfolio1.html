            <p class="overflow ellipsis">When our school purchased a Tormach Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) mill, another student and I took the lead on its assembly. The experience spurred me to better understand what was involved in the design of a CNC machine—so I modeled a 3-axis CNC router that could be used as a desktop fabrication tool. 

            In addition to completing the mechanical design, I planned out the electronics and determined the theoretical specifications of the machine.<a href="#cncrouter">[More]</a></p>

                <p class="overflow ellipsis">In a partner project, I created a mechanical model of the linkages responsible for the mantis shrimp's strike. The mantis shrimp is an aquatic crustacean that uses a pair of short "claws" to strike its prey. The claws move so fast they can break glass and cause air cavitation bubbles in the water—with accelerations up to 10,400g (Patek et al. 2004). 

                My classmate and I started by prototyping the linkage with cardboard and LEGOs. Using journal articles that described the mechanics of the mantis shrimp's strike, I designed a CAD model of the linkage mechanism that my classmate then fabricated.<a href="#mantis-shrimp">[More]</a></p>

                <p class="overflow ellipsis">Students in my 10th grade African History class were asked to create a poster representing one of six famous African musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries. My team took the project a little farther, creating a world map in which each strand of yarn represents one of singer Angelique Kidjo’s global connections—her inspirations, cultural influences, concerts, and charity work. For this team project, I designed and led the fabrication of the map, which is CNC routed.<a href="#kidjo">[More]</a></p>

                <p class="overflow ellipsis">I created a 3D periodic table of the elements where the height of each element represents its electronegativity, or the relative ability of a given element to attract an electron. I designed the model and CNC machined it out of medium-density fiberboard (MDF).

                The patterns chemical properties exhibit across the periodic table are a core concept in chemistry, yet they’re often hard to remember. By depicting chemical theory in the physical form, the model can be used as a teaching tool to provide students with a tactile sense of the elements.

                After finishing the project, I realized the table could be especially valuable to visually impaired students, who often experience difficulty accessing STEM subjects. My mind immediately jumped to an expansion of the project, where I envision creating a repository of open-source teaching tools that makerspaces could fabricate for their communities or distribute to those in low-income schools or in the developing world.<a href="#ptable">[More]</a></p>
